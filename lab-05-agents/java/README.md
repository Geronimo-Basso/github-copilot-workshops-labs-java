# GitHub copilot documentation lab

This repository contains a collection of challenges to improve your skills with GitHub Copilot to understand and distinguish between Copilot modes: Autocompletion, Chat, and Agent.

## Pre-requisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor that supports GitHub Copilot.
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) extensions installed.
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository. 
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your favorite editor.

## Challenges

### Basic Copilot Autocomplete

    Open a file, such as EmployeeController.java

    Write:
    // Method to check if a number is prime  
    Watch Copilot suggest Java code and accept with Tab.

    Try another function, for instance:
    // Method to compute factorial  
    Edit the generated code and see if more relevant suggestions appear.

**Copilot Chat**

    Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code).

    Ask questions like:
    ‚ÄúHow can I inject a service into this controller?‚Äù

    ‚ÄúWhy am I getting a NullPointerException on line 25?‚Äù

    Request examples, like:
    ‚ÄúShow me how to read a file line by line in Java.‚Äù

    Use chat to help debug a deliberate bug you add (e.g., null pointer, off-by-one error).

**Copilot Agent Mode Usage**

    Access Agent Mode via the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), then search for ‚ÄúCopilot Agent: ...‚Äù, or use the dedicated icon.

    Give high-level tasks such as:
    ‚ÄúRefactor all controllers to use constructor dependency injection.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúGenerate unit tests for all public methods in the service package.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúConvert all Exception handling to use custom exceptions.‚Äù

    Review the steps or plan the Agent provides. Accept or adjust as needed.
    Approve and let the Agent make code changes across files as necessary.
    If possible, interact with the Agent to ask for explanations of changes.

    Try a secondary task, e.g.:
    ‚ÄúAdd Javadoc comments to all public classes in the model package.‚Äù

**Custom Chat modes**

    Objective: Experiment with Custom chat modes that define specific behaviors and tools for GitHub Copilot Chat, enabling enhanced context-aware assistance for particular tasks or workflows.

    Instructions:

    Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code).
    Explore the different available chat modes and how they can help you in your workflow in this repository https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/README.chatmodes.md

    Create a custom mode 'Best Mode' in VS Code using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and selecting "Chat: New Mode file" and pasting the content from the Best Mode chat mode to get more precise and detailed answers, which you can find at https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/chatmodes/4.1-Beast.chatmode.md

    Try using a specific chat mode for a particular task, such as code generation or solving doubts.
    Compare the results obtained with different chat modes and adjust your approach as needed.

**Computer Vision in multimodal models**

    Objective: Explore the capabilities of multimodal models that can process and understand both text and images.

    Instructions:

    Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+' in VS Code).

    Add the image EmployeeManagementUI.png located in this folder to the chat by dragging and dropping it into the chat window.

    Ask Copilot to implement a web-based user interface for the Employee Management System based on the provided image.

    Review the suggestions and code generated by Copilot.
    Make sure the code is correct and functional.
    
    Expected API Endpoints (once fixed)
    GET /employees - List all employees
    POST /employees - Add a new employee
    DELETE /employees/<id> - Delete an employee by ID
    PUT /employees/<id> - Update an employee by ID


# üéÅ Bonus Track

In this section, you‚Äôll explore **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** in action. Follow these steps to try it out:  

1. **Download** the following repository: *[https://github.com/Geronimo-Basso/github-coding-agent-demo]*
2. **Create** a new Git repo with the code and upload it to GitHub.
3. **Explore** the repository briefly ‚Äî you can even ask Copilot directly on GitHub to explain parts of the code.  
4. **Create a new issue** in the repository. We suggest naming it:

   You can structure the issue like this (or adapt it as you prefer):  

   **Summary**  
   Add UI controls and filtering logic so users can filter NBA players by height and weight in the Streamlit interface.  

   **Motivation**  
   Users can currently filter by name, team, school, country, position, and draft year. Adding height and weight filters will make it easier to search by physical attributes.  

   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Add height and weight sliders (min/max or range) to the sidebar.  
   - Filter results update immediately when adjusted.  
   - Include only players whose values fall within the selected range.  
   - Display units clearly (e.g., inches, pounds).  
   - Handle edge cases (invalid ranges, missing data, etc.).  

   **Implementation Notes**  
   - Check `nba-mock-data/players.csv` for column names and units.  
   - Filtering happens client-side since the CSV is loaded in memory.  
   - Add proper validation and unit labels in the UI.  
   - Update the README with details about the new filters.  

4. **Assign the issue** to **GitHub Copilot Agent**.  
5. **Observe and review** how Copilot handles the implementation.  
6. **Merge** the changes once ready ‚Äî and don‚Äôt stop there! Try asking Copilot for more improvements or creative additions.  


# Testing Employee API with curl

## Get All Employees
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/employees
```

## Get Employee by ID
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.

## Create a New Employee
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/employees -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}'
```

## Update an Existing Employee
```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "Jane",
  "surname": "Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}'
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.

## Delete an Employee
```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.
